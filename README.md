## 1. Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating web pages. It structures content on the web and tells the browser how to display text, images, and other elements.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Introduction to HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph in HTML.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML (HTML5 in this case).
- `<html>`: The root element that wraps all the content on the page.
- `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as its title and linked resources.
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains the content of the webpage, such as text, images, and other elements.
- `<h1>`: A heading tag, used here for the main heading. `h1` is the largest heading.
- `<p>`: A paragraph tag, used for blocks of text.

---

## 2. Basic HTML Structure

Every HTML document follows a basic structure, ensuring it is well-formed and correctly interpreted by browsers.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Explanation:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Informs the browser that this is an HTML5 document.
- `<html>`: The container for the entire HTML document.
- `<head>`: Contains information that is not displayed on the page itself, like the page title and links to stylesheets.
- `<title>`: The title of the page, which appears in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Contains all the visible content of the webpage.
- `<h1>`: A primary heading for the content.
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph of text.

## 3. Text Formatting

HTML provides various tags to format text, making it bold, italicized, highlighted, etc.

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is a <strong>bold</strong> text and this is <em>italic</em> text.</p>
<p>This is a <mark>highlighted</mark> text.</p>
<p>This is <del>deleted</del> text and this is <ins>inserted</ins> text.</p>
```

### Explanation:
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph of text.
- `<strong>`: Makes the enclosed text bold, indicating strong emphasis.
- `<em>`: Italicizes the enclosed text, indicating emphasis.
- `<mark>`: Highlights the enclosed text, usually with a yellow background.
- `<del>`: Represents text that has been deleted or is no longer accurate.
- `<ins>`: Represents text that has been inserted or added.

## 4. HTML Lists

HTML allows you to create lists, which can be either ordered (numbered) or unordered (bulleted).

**Example:**

```html
<!-- Unordered List -->
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

<!-- Ordered List -->
<ol>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

### Explanation:
- `<ul>`: Creates an unordered (bulleted) list.
- `<ol>`: Creates an ordered (numbered) list.
- `<li>`: Represents a list item within `<ul>` or `<ol>`.

## 5. Links

Links (or hyperlinks) allow users to navigate from one page to another, either within the same website or to an external site.

**Example:**

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
```

### Explanation:
- `<a>`: The anchor tag, used to create a hyperlink.
- `href="URL"`: The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.

## 6. Images

Images can be embedded into HTML pages using the `<img>` tag.

**Example:**

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful scenery" width="600">
```

### Explanation:
- `<img>`: The image tag, used to embed images.
- `src="image.jpg"`: Specifies the path to the image file.

        <th>Header 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

## 8. Forms and Input Elements

Forms allow users to submit data to a server, and input elements are the fields where users enter data.

**Example:**

```html
<form action="/submit" method="post">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">

## 11. Meta Tags and SEO Basics

Meta tags provide information about your webpage to search engines and browsers, which is crucial for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

**Example:**

```html
<head>
    <meta name="description" content="This is a sample webpage that demonstrates HTML structure.">
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, Web Development">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Meta Tags and SEO</title>
</head>
```

### Explanation:
- `<meta name="description">`: Provides a short description of the webpage, which search engines use in search results.
- `<meta name="keywords">`: Specifies keywords related to the content of the webpage.
- `<meta name="viewport">`: Controls the layout on mobile browsers. The `content` attribute values `width=device-width` and `initial-scale=1.0` ensure proper scaling on mobile devices.

## 13. HTML Entities

HTML entities are used to display reserved characters or special symbols.

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is how you write an ampersand: &amp;</p>
<p>This is how you write a less than symbol: &lt;</p>
<p>This is how you write a greater than symbol: &gt;</p>
```

### Explanation:
